approaches, the day was filled with opportunities for learning, connecting, and building together.

## A Global Agenda

Featuring more than 30 international speakers from the US, Spain, Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil, and Guatemala,
alongside national leaders, the event offered a diverse range of talks, workshops, and live demos.
Key topics included optimization, security, and scalability in Kubernetes, with a focus on tools and strategies
to maximize the potential of cloud-native environments.


## Highlights and Key Topics

The event delved into crucial topics related to Kubernetes optimization and efficiency, emphasizing tools that
enhance resource management, security, and application scalability. Highlights included:
- Karpenter + Amazon EKS: Intelligent autoscaling with Spot instances and Graviton processors for optimal performance and cost efficiency.
- Security First: Hardening strategies to comply with regulations like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR, fortifying clusters against real threats.
- API Gateway, OpenTelemetry, and Cilium: Enhanced visibility, traceability, and control in distributed environments.
- Istio + KubeVirt: Hybrid architectures combining the best of containers and virtual machines.
- Cloud-native CI/CD: Migrations from GitHub Actions to solutions like Tekton and KubeVirt.
- Green Infrastructure: Best practices to reduce environmental impact without compromising efficiency or budget.

## More Than an Event, an Experience

KCD Mexico 2025 was more than just a conference; it was a community-building experience. Attendees not only learned
from global leaders but also shared experiences, challenges, and lessons with peers from across Latin America.
The Q&A sessions sparked in-depth discussions about implementation, common pitfalls, and innovative production solutions,
all in a collaborative, open, and energetic environment.

## Community + Technology = Future

The event reaffirmed the community's vital role in the growth of the Kubernetes ecosystem. Topics such as DevOps,
CI/CD, Crossplane, EKS, Istio, and KubeVirt were presented as concrete tools to tackle current infrastructure challenges.
This event not only strengthened the local community but also equipped each participant with ideas, connections,
and skills ready to be put into practice.

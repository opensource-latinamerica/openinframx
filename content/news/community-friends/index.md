Community friend rules

As a company, send us an email with what you can help us with, and your logo and link to your webpage will be added here for 12 months.
The order of the logos and names doesn't mean anything other than chronological order.

Examples can be the following:

- Cloud hosting for our community apps and tools.
- Meetup venues, beers, pizza, etc.
- Stickers, t-shirts, pins, etc.
- Speakers for remote or Mexico-based events
- Conference access that we can offer to our community.
- Whatever else you may think, it isn't money.

As a person who gives a talk to our community and/or helps in any way, your name will be added and never deleted.
